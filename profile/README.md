## Are universities accepting GRE at home?

Yes, the vast majority of universities are still accepting GRE at-home scores. Here's why:

-   **Equivalency:** The at-home GRE test is identical in format, content, and scoring to the test center version. ETS (the creators of the GRE) and universities have confirmed there is no difference in how scores from either version are considered.
-   **Wide Acceptance:** Most universities adjusted their policies during the pandemic to accept at-home scores and continue to do so.
-   **Flexibility:** The at-home test offers students greater flexibility in scheduling and the convenience of taking the test in a familiar environment.

**Important Notes:**

-   **Always Double-Check:** It's always best to directly verify the specific admissions requirements of your target universities. Some may have unique policies. Look for information on their graduate program websites or contact the admissions office.
-   **Future Changes:** While unlikely, it's possible policies could change in the future. Stay updated on the latest GRE information available on the official ETS website: [https://www.ets.org/GRE](https://www.ets.org/GRE)

## Can I pay someone to take my GRE exam?

## Can we cheat in GRE exam?

## Can you skip questions in computer GRE?
Absolutely! One of the great advantages of the computer-delivered GRE is the ability to skip questions within a section. Here's how it helps:

**Strategic Time Management:**

-   **Focus on what you know:** Skip difficult or time-consuming questions and focus on the ones you can answer confidently and quickly. This ensures you get points for the easier problems first.
-   **Return later:** You can mark difficult questions for review and return to them if you have time remaining at the end of the section.

**Mental Reset:**

-   **Avoid getting stuck:** If you're struggling with a particular question, skipping it can help you avoid getting bogged down and losing valuable time.
-   **Fresh perspective:** You can come back to a skipped question later with a clearer mind.

**How to Skip and Review:**

-   **"Mark" Button:** Use the "Mark" button to flag questions you want to revisit.
-   **"Review" Screen:** The "Review" screen at the end of each section shows you all the questions you've answered, skipped, or marked, making it easy to go back.

**Important Note:** Don't overuse the skipping feature. Remember, your score is partly based on the number of questions you answer correctly. Guessing on a skipped question is better than leaving it blank.


## Can you still take the GRE at home?
Yes, you can still take the GRE at home. The GRE at-home option, launched during the pandemic, has proven successful and remains a convenient alternative to taking the test at a testing center.

Here's what you need to know:

-   **Availability:** The GRE at-home test is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
-   **Equivalency:** The at-home version is identical in content, format, and scoring to the test-center GRE.
-   **Technical Requirements:** You'll need a reliable computer, webcam, microphone, and internet connection. Check the ETS website for specific system requirements: [https://www.ets.org/gre/test-takers/general-test/register/at-home-testing.html](https://www.ets.org/gre/test-takers/general-test/register/at-home-testing.html)
-   **Monitoring:** The test is monitored by a live human proctor through ProctorU to ensure integrity.

**How to Register:**

1.  Visit the ETS website: [https://www.ets.org/gre](https://www.ets.org/gre)
2.  Create an ETS account or log in to your existing one.

## Cheating in GRE?
If you are thinking about cheating in GRE exam, we are here to help you. Ofcourse everybody will tell you against cheating on GRE exam and they are right but there are situations where you can do better things with your time instead of putting in efforts and energy to prepare for GRE. In that case, cheating on the GRE at home seems a good option. Again, would not recommend it because it's unethical and immoral. But we can help you, get in touch on our telegram.

## Do universities reject home based GRE?
The vast majority of universities do NOT reject home-based GRE scores. Here's why:

-   **ETS Confirmation:** ETS, the organization that administers the GRE, has repeatedly confirmed that home-based GRE scores hold the same weight as test center scores. There's no indication on your score report of how you took the test.
-   **University Acceptance:** Most universities adjusted their policies during the pandemic to accept the at-home version and continue to do so.
-   **Focus on Scores:** Universities primarily care about your GRE scores themselves, not how you obtained them. A strong score, regardless of test format, demonstrates your abilities.

**However, it's crucial to remember:**

-   **Always Double-Check:** A very small number of universities may have specific policies. It's always best to verify the admissions requirements for your target programs on their websites or by contacting their admissions office.
-   **Changing Landscape:** While acceptance is currently widespread, it's good practice to stay up-to-date on GRE policies on the ETS website ([https://www.ets.org/gre](https://www.ets.org/gre)) in case things change in the future.

**Bottom Line:** Focus on achieving the best possible GRE score. Whether you take the test at home or at a test center shouldn't be a major concern for most applicants.

## Does it count against you to guess on the GRE?
Absolutely not! There's no penalty for guessing on the GRE. In fact, it's highly recommended that you guess on any questions you don't know the answer to. Here's why:

-   **Scoring:** Your GRE score is based solely on the number of questions you answer correctly. There is no deduction of points for wrong answers.
-   **Increased Odds:** Even if you're unsure of the answer, making an educated guess gives you a chance of getting the question right. Leaving a question blank guarantees zero points.
-   **Elimination Strategies:** If you can confidently eliminate even a couple of answer choices, your chances of guessing correctly improve significantly.

**Guessing Smartly:**

-   **Don't Guess Blindly:** If you have absolutely no idea about a question, a random guess is still better than nothing. But use your time wisely – focus on questions where you can apply some knowledge or logic to increase your success rate.
-   **Process of Elimination:** Look for clues and patterns within the question and answer choices that might help you narrow down the options.
-   **Manage Time:** Don't spend too long agonizing over one question. If you're stuck, make an educated guess, mark the question for review, and move on. You might be able to revisit it later.

**Remember:** The GRE is as much about strategic test-taking as it is about knowledge. Don't leave points on the table by skipping questions – take that calculated guess!

## GRE at home bathroom breaks?
Unfortunately, unscheduled bathroom breaks are not permitted during the GRE at-home test. Here's why:

-   **Security Concerns:** ETS implements strict security measures to prevent cheating and uphold the integrity of the exam. Allowing unscheduled breaks could create opportunities for someone to compromise the test.
-   **Test Interruption:** Leaving your testing area could potentially invalidate your score.
-   **Time Management:** The GRE sections are designed to be manageable without requiring breaks.

**What you should do:**

-   **Prepare beforehand:** Use the restroom and make sure you have everything you need (water, tissues, etc.) before starting the test. **GRE at home breaks** are not allowed.
- 
**Important Note:** If you have a documented medical condition that requires frequent bathroom breaks, ETS offers accommodations. You'll need to apply for these accommodations in advance and provide supporting documentation.

**Features:**

-   **Basic Functions:** The GRE calculator includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and percentage functions.
-   **"Transfer Display" Button:** This allows you to transfer your calculation result directly into the answer box on the test.

**Limitations:**

-   **No Advanced Functions:** The calculator doesn't have advanced scientific or graphing capabilities.
-   **Awkward to Use:** Because it's on-screen, the calculator can be a little slower to use than a physical one.

-   **Brief Interruptions:** If you experience a brief internet outage, you'll be automatically reconnected to the proctor when your internet resumes.
-   **Longer Outage:**
    -   Inform the proctor immediately via chat or speaking out loud.
    -   Do your best to troubleshoot the issue quickly.
    -   If you can't restore the connection, the proctor might suggest rescheduling for a later time.
-   **Rescheduling:** If the outage severely impacts your test, you can contact ETS to reschedule your GRE. You may need to provide evidence of technical difficulties.

**Important Notes:**

-   **Don't Panic:** Stay calm and try to address the issue. The proctor will understand and provide guidance as best as they can.
-   **Document the Issue:** If possible, note down the time and duration of the outage, and any screenshots or error messages. This may help if you need to contest decisions made by ETS.
-   **ETS Support:** ETS has resources for technical troubleshooting. Check their website for instructions on what to do in different situations.

**Always Refer to ETS Guidelines**

## GRE at home last date
The GRE at-home test does not have a "last date" in the traditional sense. Here's why:

-   **Availability:** The GRE at-home is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can schedule it for any time and date that works for you.
-   **No Overall Deadline:** Unlike exams tied to specific seasons or admission cycles, the GRE has no overall deadline.
-   **Application Deadlines Matter:** What's important are the application deadlines for your target universities. You need to take the GRE with enough time to receive your scores and submit them before those deadlines.

**Things to Consider:**

-   **Score Reporting Time:** It takes around 10-15 days for ETS to send your official GRE scores after your test date.
-   **University Application Deadlines:** Research the specific deadlines for the programs you're applying to. Plan your GRE test date accordingly, allowing enough time for scores to arrive.
-   **Retesting:** If you want the option to retake the GRE, factor that into your scheduling as well. There's a 21-day waiting period between test attempts.

**How to Find Test Dates:**

1.  **ETS Website:** Visit the GRE section on the ETS website: [https://www.ets.org/gre](https://www.ets.org/gre)
2.  **Registration:** Begin the GRE at-home registration process and select your preferred location. You'll see available dates and times.

**Important:** While the GRE at-home testing option itself doesn't have a last date, it's possible policies could change in the future. Always check the latest information on the official ETS website.

## GRE at home not accepted
It's very common for universities to not accept GRE at-home scores. However, the vast majority do because:

-   **ETS Confirmation:** ETS (the organization that administers the GRE) has repeatedly stated that GRE at-home scores hold the same weight and validity as test-center scores. There's no distinction made on your score report.
-   **Wide Acceptance:** Most universities adapted their policies during the pandemic to accept the at-home version and continue to do so.
-   **Test Equivalence:** The format, content, difficulty, and scoring of the at-home and test center versions are identical.

**However, there are a few potential scenarios to consider:**

-   **Outdated Information:** A very small number of universities may have outdated admissions information on their websites.
-   **Specific Program Exceptions:** It's theoretically possible that individual programs within a university have unique policies. This would be highly unusual.
-   **Changing Landscape:** While acceptance is widespread currently, it's good practice to stay up-to-date on GRE policies in case things change in the future.

**What to Do:**

1.  **Double-Check:** Always verify the specific admissions requirements for your target universities on their official websites or by contacting their admissions offices. Look for clear statements about accepting the GRE at-home version.
2.  **Contact the University:** If you're unsure or notice conflicting information, contact the relevant graduate program directly for clarification.
3.  **Stay Updated:** Monitor the official ETS GRE website ([https://www.ets.org/gre](https://www.ets.org/gre)) for any major policy changes.

**Bottom Line:** Focus on achieving the best possible GRE score. With strong scores, whether you take the test at home or at a center shouldn't be a major concern for most applicants.

## GRE at home note taking
Here's what you need to know about note-taking for the GRE at-home exam:

**Allowed Methods:**

-   **Small Whiteboard:** Ensure it has a clean, erasable surface. A typical size might be around 12" x 9".
-   **Sheet of Paper in Transparent Sheet Protector:** This offers another erasable surface. Use regular 8.5" x 11" paper.

**Restrictions:**

-   **One Method Only:** You must choose between the whiteboard or the sheet protector method. You cannot use both.
-   **Erasable Markers Only:** No pens or pencils are permitted.

**Important Considerations:**

-   **Visibility to Proctor:** Choose marker colors that will be easily visible to the proctor on your webcam.
-   **Erasing Notes:** At the end of the test, you'll be asked to show the proctor that you've completely erased your notes.

**Why the Limitations?**

ETS implements these restrictions to ensure test security and prevent the possibility of pre-written or permanent notes that could provide an unfair advantage.

**Note-Taking Strategies:**

-   **Practice Beforehand:** Get comfortable with your chosen note-taking medium. Practice writing and erasing quickly, as time during the test is precious.
-   **Prioritize Key Information:** Focus on jotting down essential formulas, problem-solving steps, or temporary calculations. Avoid writing long sentences or excessive details.
-   **Utilize the Review Function:** Remember that you can mark questions and navigate back to them within a section, which can reduce some of the pressure to take extensive notes.

**Additional Tips:**

-   **Mental Math:** Practice mental math and estimation techniques to reduce reliance on note-taking for simple calculations.
-   **Strategic Marking:** Use the "Mark" function effectively to flag questions you might want to return to later.
